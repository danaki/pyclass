Five repetitions can be represented with a single, larger numeral; to represent four, use the next larger numeral, but precede it with a numeral to subtract from it. Thus, IIII is invalid and would instead be written as IV (one less than five). Likewise, XC represents 90 (10 less than 100), and XL represents 40 (10 less than 50).\n",
